thinarchive
===========

A backup and archival script, that uses rsync with hard-links to provide de-duplicated backup storage.

This script was developed and tested on Mac OS X Yosemite (v10.10.1), but should work on any Unix or Linux operating system.

It requires rsync.  I have included a Launchd config file for use with OS X, and a crontab file for use with Linux or Unix systems.
